You can choose between the ordinary form of the liturgy or the extra-ordinary form (tridentine mass).

## How to load a calendar?

Calendar applications are available on each smartphone. You can also install an online app, like _Google Calendar_. A calendar can be loaded in two ways: 

- either by copying the URL (http:// . . .) and add a subscription in your calendar app,
- or by downloading the ICS or ICAL-file and importing it in your calendar.

The first opion is perferred, because it will make sure the calendar is kept up-to-date.
